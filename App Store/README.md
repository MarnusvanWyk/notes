# Internal App Store & Backstage Integration Architecture
10. **Welcome Message**
- Post summary in Teams or Slack with all relevant links (repo, board, dashboards, ServiceNow record).

## 5. Terraform vs. Azure Automation
### Terraform/Bicep (IaC)
- **Pros**:
- Desired-state with drift detection.
- Reviewable diffs (plan/apply model).
- Policy and compliance integration.
- Works with GitOps and version control.
- **Use For**:
- Provisioning new resources (AKS, DB, DNS, Key Vault, etc.).

### Azure Automation
- **Pros**:
- Excellent for Day-2 operations and event-driven tasks.
- Integrates natively with Azure Monitor.
- **Use For**:
- Secret rotations.
- Backup and restore.
- Resource cleanup and tag reconciliation.
- Compliance remediation.

> ✅ Combined pattern: Terraform (Day-0/Day-1 provisioning) + Azure Automation (Day-2 operations).

## 6. Backstage Integration
### Option A: Backstage as the Front-End
- Use Backstage Software Templates for project creation.
- Scaffolder actions handle all provisioning tasks.
- Ideal if Backstage is your single developer portal.

### Option B: App Store Triggers Backstage
- Your App Store is the orchestrator.
- Once resources are provisioned, call Backstage APIs:
- `POST /api/catalog/entities` to register new component.
- `POST /api/scaffolder/v2/tasks` to trigger templates.
- Backstage acts as catalog + documentation hub.

**Recommended:** Use Option B (App Store orchestrates everything) since it provides more control, branding, and flexibility.

## 7. Governance & Guardrails
- **Multi-env strategy:** dev, qa, prod with promotion pipelines.
- **Secrets management:** Key Vault with automatic rotation.
- **Policy as Code:** Azure Policy + OPA.
- **Security:** SAST, DAST, SBOMs, and RBAC.
- **Observability:** Azure Monitor + Grafana dashboards.
- **FinOps:** Budgets, tagging, and auto-shutdowns.
- **Lifecycle management:** Archive/decommission workflow.

## 8. AI Enablement
Generative AI enhances several steps:
- Generate tailored READMEs, PRDs, ADRs, and runbooks.
- Suggest dependency structure and code quality improvements.
- Provide PR review comments using internal policies.
- Draft ServiceNow summaries and change requests.
- Generate initial unit tests and compliance docs.

> Guardrails: Tenant-hosted Azure OpenAI, no secret leakage, policy-controlled prompts.

---

## 9. Phased Implementation Plan
### Phase 1
- Deploy Backstage base instance.
- One archetype end-to-end: repo → AKS → DNS → ServiceNow → Board → Backstage.
- Manual approvals for governance.

### Phase 2
- Expand archetypes (API, SPA, Worker, Data Job).
- Introduce GitOps, policy enforcement, and observability standards.
- Add AI-generated documentation.

### Phase 3
- Cost optimization (FinOps), lifecycle management, DR.
- Compliance automation and stronger security gates.
- Expand AI-assisted developer workflows.

---

## 10. Summary
This architecture creates a seamless, compliant, and automated internal developer experience:
- **Terraform/Bicep** for infrastructure.
- **Azure Automation** for operations.
- **Backstage** for visibility and discovery.
- **ServiceNow** for governance.
- **GenAI** for code/document automation.

The result is a true internal **App Store** that turns idea intake into production-ready, governed deployments with minimal human intervention.
